On the Estemeed Scientifc Role Model of Mine
============================================

Within the confines of this academic setting, the individual whom
I hold in highest regard not only boasts an engaging smile but also
possesses a remarkable sense of humor, complemented by an array of
vibrant notebooks.

Yet, it is their distinct quantifiable attribute that stands out
most prominently: their name, when converted into an integer value
and squared modulo 13113180816763040887576781992067364636289723584543479342139964290889855987378109190372819034517913477911738026253141916115785049387269347257060732629562571,
astonishingly results in 11295696938311339473824077083449119515455766620804723271417795055153345707595152245303924808555919718654126902417279389829240793581636850443514989727075129.

Furthermore, the greatest integer that does not surpass the cube root
of the aforementioned squared name equals 25255532621039290870985214051278041571596463385115156541846401100873975663406085683775323107488.
This computational detail adds another layer of distinction.

It is likely that by this point, many of you have discerned the identity
of this distinguished role model.
