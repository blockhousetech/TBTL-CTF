My Favorite Classmate
=====================

My favorite person in this class has a beautiful smile,
great sense of humour, and lots of colorful notebooks.

However, their most distinctive feature is the fact that
you can represent their name as an integer value, square
it modulo 1839221045943946468749590061514704444096822140639024607242755810381377444892113085421174752142441,
and you'll get 1804671962891598586831251656431345607187951389706305029952427287330950271224234433906630527235349.

By now, all of you have probably guessed who I'm talking about.
