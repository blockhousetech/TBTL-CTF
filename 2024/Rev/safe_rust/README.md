# Safe Rust

## Description

A few years back, a colleague of ours joined the company and uploaded some
secure Rust code to the repository. Unfortunately, the repository has since
been deleted, leaving us with only the executable file. The issue we're facing
now is that the binary isn't functioning properly. Could you assist us in
extracting the flag from the executable?
