# Mexico City Tour

## Description

Our colleague is currently on vacation in Mexico City and is using a local
website to calculate distances between subway stations. We have information
that the database contains a city FLAG. Can you uncover the secret? Perhaps we
can identify a vulnerability and secure a free vacation for our colleague.
