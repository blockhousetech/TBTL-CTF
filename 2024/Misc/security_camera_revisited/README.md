# Security Camera Revisited

## Description

Due to [last year's
incident](https://github.com/blockhousetech/TBTL-CTF/tree/master/2023/Misc/security_camera),
our security team got transferred to a brand-new, cozy office.

The incident was successfully mitigated by placing the security camera so that
it doesn't see the screen.

We believed our setup was completely secure, but hackers managed extract some
sensitive data once again!

We inspected the [security camera
footage](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xc8POr3KggG-t7cnrkjdvkLPcx9kAYW-/view?usp=drive_link),
but there's nothing there!
